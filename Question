I do not see an issue tab so please excuse me I will choose this method to catch your atention.
I am trying to get Favorites contacts with the plugin but I noticed that whatever contact type I mark as favorites 
under my andorid phone, the object contacts taken with 

        var options      = new ContactFindOptions();
        options.multiple = true;
        options.filter = "";
        var fields       = ["*"];

        navigator.contacts.find(fields, cb, onError, options);
        
is returning the: categories: null !
I was reading somewhere that should come as {"Favorites_", "Other Category"} or so ?

Thx for your possible answer
